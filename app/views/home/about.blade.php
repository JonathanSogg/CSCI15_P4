        <h1>About Project 4</h1>
        <p>In this project I went for a simple photo uploading site where you can share you pictures with others. At the moment it's reserved to direct link sharing, not inter-site, but you can set up your own profile for your user. Originally I was going to try to set up a kind of "friend" system so that people could browse each other's pictures but I wasn't able to get that working quite right. Thanks for checking this out!</p>
