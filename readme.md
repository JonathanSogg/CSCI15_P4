## Description
A simple photo sharing website in the vein of imgur or photobucket. Upload pictures and share the links with people to be able to share them. Was originally going to do a kind of friend system to browse others' pictures but I wasn't able to implement that in quite enough time. You can edit a basic profile for yourself and upload/delete any kind of picture you'd like (under 2MB). Thanks for checking this out!

##Outside Code
jQuery scripts for some effects as well as Twitter Bootstrap for the looks and some effects.
